## Submission Instructions

### Overview

As an avid reader, I run into the problem of forgetting the books I want to read, and forgetting the name or author of books I enjoyed. My project is for serious readers: for readers who have so many books they want ot read, they need a list to keep track. Users will be able to log into their own account to add, delete, edit, and mark their books as "read". My app will allow readers to add books they want to read to their list, either by searching in a database or adding on their own. Users can delete or edit books in their list. Users can mark the book as complete and rate it.

### Features

User login: Users will be able to create an individul account and log in to the application. 
Add Books: Users will be able to create a reading list where they can add the book title and author, edit the list, or delete entries.
Completed List: Users will be able to mark a book as read, rate it, and move it to a "Completed" page.
Search for Books: Users will be able to access an external API to search for books to add to their list.
