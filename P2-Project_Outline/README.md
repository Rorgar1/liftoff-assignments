## Submission Instructions

### Overview
In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an “elevator pitch” for your project. This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?
My project is for serious readers: for readers who have so many books they want ot read, they need a list to keep track. Users will be able to log into their own account to add, delete, edit, and mark their books as "read". My app will allow readers to add books they want to read to their list, either by searching in a database or adding on their own. Users can delete or edit books in their list. Users can mark the book as complete and rate it. 

### Features
Include Features List 3-5 features that you will implement in your project. Each feature should have a name and a 1-2 sentence description. Here are a few examples for a blog application:
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Search: Users will be able to search for blog posts containing given text.
